This is the code that currently runs [http://ultimatewerewolf.herokuapp.com](http://ultimatewerewolf.herokuapp.com), a free online version of the hidden-role social deduction game One Night Ultimate Werewolf. I built this app because I love playing this game, and I've always wanted to learn Meteor and full-stack web development.
